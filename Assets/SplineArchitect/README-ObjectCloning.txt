================================
Spline Architect - Object Cloning is an addon for Spline Architect.

In the SplineArchitect main folder you have:
1. 'Installation.pdf' for setup.
2. 'User manual - Addons.pdf' for usage instructions.
3. Look at scenes MeshDeformation, BasicTrafficSystem or BasicTrainSystem in the "Example" folder for usage demonstrations.

These PDF files and scenes are not included in this addon's package. They are part of the main version of Spline Architect, which you should already have when downloading this addon.
